|0
|DST
|R
|`1` to indicate that it is currently in debug mode.

The hardware sets this bit to `1` when a debug exception is triggered in non-debug mode.

When this bit is `1`, the `ERTN` instruction is executed to clear this bit to `0`.

|7:1
|DRev
|R
|The version number of the debugging mechanism.
`1` is the initial version.

|8
|DEI
|R
|`1` indicates that the debug exception type caught in debug mode is **DE**bug **I**nterrupt (DEI).

|9
|DCL
|R
|`1` indicates that the type of debug exception caught in debug mode is a **D**ebug **C**a**L**l exception (DCL).

|10
|DFW
|R
|`1` indicates that the type of debug exception caught in debug mode is the **D**ebug **F**etch **W**atchpoint exception (DFW).

|11
|DMW
|R
|`1` indicates that the debug exception type caught in debug mode is the **D**ebug load/store (**M**emory) **W**atchpoint exception (DMW).

a|When a non-debug exception occurs in debug mode, the exception type code is recorded here.
The meaning of the codes here is basically the same as the definitions in <<table-of-exception-encoding,Table of exception encoding>>, with only three differences:

* The TLB refill exception reuses the `0x7` exception code;
* The debug call exception uses the `0xC` exception code;
* The machine error exception uses the `0xE` exception code.

[[counter-compensation]]
==== Counter Compensation (`CNTC`)

This register can be configured by the software to correct the timer's readout value.
The final readout value will be the original timer count value plus the timer compensation value.
It is important to note that configuring this register does not directly change the timer's count value.

In LA32, this register is 32-bit and its value will be sign extended to `64` bits and then added to the original counter value.

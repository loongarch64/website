[[timer-identity]]
==== Timer Identity (`TID`)

Each timer in the processor has a unique identifiable number, which is configured by the software in this register.
Each timer also uniquely corresponds to a timer, and when the software reads the timer value using the `RDTIME` instruction, the timer ID number that is returned along with it is the corresponding timer number.

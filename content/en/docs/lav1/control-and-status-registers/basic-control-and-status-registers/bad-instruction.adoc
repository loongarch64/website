==== Bad Instruction (`BADI`)

This register is used to record the instruction code of the instruction that triggers the synchronous-related exception.
The so-called synchronous-related exceptions are all exceptions except the **INT**errupt (INT), the **G**uest **C**SR **H**ardware **C**hange exception (GCHC), and the **M**achine **ERR**or exception (MERR).

==== Data Save Register (`SAVE`)

The data save registers are used to temporarily store data for the system software.
Each data save register can store data from one general-purpose register.

The minimum number of data save registers is `1`, and the maximum number is `16`.
The exact number of registers can be found in `CSR.PRCFG1.SAVENum`.
Starting from `SAVE0`, the addresses of each `SAVE` register are `0x30`, `0x31`, ... , `0x30+SAVENum-1`.

All data save control and status registers have the same format, as shown in the table.

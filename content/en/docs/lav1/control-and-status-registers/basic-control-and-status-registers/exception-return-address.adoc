==== Exception Return Address (`ERA`)

When an exception is triggered, if the exception type is neither a TLB refill exception nor a machine error exception, the `PC` of the instruction that triggered the exception will be recorded in this register.

|When an exception is triggered:

this field remains unchanged if the exception is a TLB refill exception or a machine error exception;

otherwise, the hardware records the `PC` of the instruction that triggered the exception here.
For LA64, in this case, if the privilege level that triggered the exception is in 32-bit address mode, then the higher 32 bits of the recorded `PC` are forced to `0`.

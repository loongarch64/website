=== Control and Status Registers Related to Watchpoints

LoongArch defines hardware watchpoint functions for fetch and load/store operations.
After the software configures the watchpoints for fetch and load/store, the processor hardware will monitor the access addresses of the fetch and load/store operations and trigger a watchpoint exception when the watchpoint setting conditions are met.

The control and status registers associated with the watchpoints are used as interfaces for software to configure the watchpoints for fetch and load/store operations.
Load/store watchpoints and fetch watchpoints each have a similar layout of control and status registers, a register for the overall configuration of all watchpoints, a register for the status of all watchpoints, and the four registers.
The address of the overall configuration register of the load/store watchpoint is `0x300`, the address of the overall status register of the load/store watchpoint is `0x301`, and the addresses of the four configuration registers from `1` to `4` of the ``n``th load/store watchpoint are `0x310+8n`, `0x311+8n`, `0x312+8n`, and `0x313+8n`, respectively.
The address of the overall configuration register of the fetch instruction watchpoint is `0x380`, the address of the overall status register of the fetch instruction watchpoint is `0x381`, and the addresses of the four configuration registers `1`â€“`4` of the ``n``th fetch instruction watchpoint are `0x390+8n`, `0x391+8n`, `0x392+8n`, `0x393+8n` in order.

The maximum number of load/store watchpoints and fetch instruction watchpoints is `14` each, and the actual number is determined by the implementation.
The software can determine how many hardware watchpoints can be used by reading the values of `CSR.MWPC.Num` and `CSR.FWPC.Num`.

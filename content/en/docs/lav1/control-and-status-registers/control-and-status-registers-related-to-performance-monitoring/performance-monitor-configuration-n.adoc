|Description

|9:0
|EvCode
|RW
|The event number of the performance event being monitored.
The definition of event numbers is divided into two parts, a part whose meaning is specified in the architecture specification and must be implemented by all processors compatible with this architecture, and a remaining part whose meaning is implementation specific and is defined by the processor's implementer.

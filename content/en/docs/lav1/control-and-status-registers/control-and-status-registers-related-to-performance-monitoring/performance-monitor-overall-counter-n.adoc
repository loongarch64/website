|GRLEN-1:0

|The counter is incremented by `1` for each performance event monitored by the performance monitor.

If the performance monitor has enabled the performance monitoring count overflow interrupt, and when the highest bit of `Count` is `1`, the interrupt is triggered.
This also means that the software can cancel the interrupt by clearing the highest bit of `Count` to `0`.

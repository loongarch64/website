==== Page Global Directory Base Address for Higher Half Address Space (`PGDH`)

This register is used to configure the base address of the global directory for the higher half address space.
The base address of the global directory must be aligned to the `4KB` bound address, so the lowest `12` bits of this register are not configurable by software and are read-only constant `0`.

|The base address of the global directory in the high half address space.
By higher half address space, it means that the `[VALEN-1]` bit of the virtual address is equal to `1`.

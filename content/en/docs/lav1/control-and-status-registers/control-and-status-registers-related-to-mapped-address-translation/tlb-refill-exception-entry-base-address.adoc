==== TLB Refill Exception Entry Base Address (`TLBRENTRY`)

This register is used to configure the entry base address of the TLB refill exception.
Since the processor core will enter direct address translation mode after the TLB refill exception is triggered, the entry base address filled here should be a physical address.

==== Registers

The registers involved in basic integer instructions include General Registers (GR) and Program Counters (PC), as shown in the figure.

===== General-purpose Registers

There are 32 **G**eneral purpose **R**egisters (GR), denoted as `r0`â€“`r31`, and the value of register `r0` is always `0`.
The length of GR is recorded as GRLEN.
The length of GR in LA32 is 32 bits, and the length of GR in LA64 is 64 bits.
There is an orthogonal relationship between basic integer instructions and general registers.
That is, from an architectural point of view, any register operand in this instruction can use any of the 32 GRs.
The only exception is that the destination register implicit in the `BL` instruction must be `r1`.
In the standard LoongArch **A**pplication **B**inary **I**nterface (ABI), `r1` is as storing the return address of a function call.

===== PC

There is only one PC, which records the address of the current instruction.
The `PC` register cannot be modified directly by instructions, it can only be modified indirectly by branch instructions, exception trap and exception return instructions.
However, the `PC` register can be directly read as the source operand of some non-branch instructions.
The length of `PC` is always the same as the length of GR.

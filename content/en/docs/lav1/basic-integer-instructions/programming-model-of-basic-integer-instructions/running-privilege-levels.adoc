==== Running Privilege Levels

LoongArch defines 4 running **P**rivilege **L**e**V**els (PLV), namely PLV0â€“PLV3.
The specific privilege level of the application is determined by the system software at runtime, and the application cannot accurately aware this.
In LoongArch, the application usually runs on PLV3.
For more information about privilege levels, see <<privilege-levels,Privilege Levels>>.

===== Privileged Resources Accessible by Applications

Generally speaking, privileged resources cannot be directly accessed by application running at a non-privileged level, but when `RPCNTL1`/`RPCNTL2`/`RPCNTL3` in `CSR.MISC` is set, the `CSRRD` instruction can be executed at the privilege level of PLV1/PLV2/PLV3 to read performance monitor counters.
For more information about performance monitor counters, see <<control-and-status-registers-related-to-performance-monitoring,Control and Status Registers Related to Performance Monitoring>>.

===== Disabling of Some Non-privileged Functions

Some non-privileged functions that are enabled by default after power-on reset can be disabled by the system software during execution.
By setting the `DRDTL1`/`DRDTL2`/`DRDTL3` bits in `CSR.MISC` to `1`, the execution of `RDTIME` instructions at the PLV1/PLV2/PLV3 level can be prohibited, or will trigger the **I**nstruction **P**rivilege error **E**xception (IPE).

=== Programming Model of Basic Integer Instruction

The basic integer instruction programming model described in this section only involves the operating environment of the application software, which is always related to some privileged resources.
Therefore, the concept of privileged resources will be introduced where necessary to ensure the completeness of the description.
Although the content of privileged resources is covered here, it will not be expanded in detail.
Readers who need a comprehensive and in-depth understanding can refer to the relevant chapters in the manual according to the prompts in the text.

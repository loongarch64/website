==== Interrupt Entry

Interrupts are treated as an exception once they are marked to the instruction by the processor, so the calculation of interrupt entries follows the rules for calculating general exception entries.
See <<exception-entry,Exception Entry>> for the rules of calculating the general exception entries.
The exception number for an interrupt is its own int number plus `64`.
The exception number for interrupt SWI0 is `64`, the exception number for interrupt SWI1 is `65`, ... , and so on.

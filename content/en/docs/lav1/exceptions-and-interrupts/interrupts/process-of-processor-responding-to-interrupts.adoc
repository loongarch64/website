==== Process of Processor Responding to Interrupts

The interrupt signal from each interrupt source is recorded by the processor in the `CSR.ESTA.IS` field.
The value of this field and the value of the local interrupt enable field configured by software in the `CSR.ECFG.LIE` field perform the bitwise AND operation to obtain a 13-bit interrupt vector (`int_vec`).
When `CSR.CRMD.IE=1` and `int_vec` is not all `0` values, the processor considers that there is an interrupt that needs to be responded to.
So the processor picks an instruction from the executed instruction stream and marks it with a special kind of exception â€” interrupt exception.

The subsequent process of the processor is the same as that of the general exception, see the description in <<general-hardware-exception-handling-of-general-exceptions,General Hardware Exception Handling of General Exceptions>>.

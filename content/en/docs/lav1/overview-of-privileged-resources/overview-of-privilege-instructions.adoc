=== Overview of Privilege Instructions

All privileged instructions are accessible only at the PLV0 privilege level.
The only exception is that when the `RPERF1`/`RPERF2`/`RPERF3` in `CSR.MISC` is configured to `1`, the `CSRRD` instruction can be executed at PLV1/PLV2/PLV3 privilege level to read the performance counter.

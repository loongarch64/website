==== TLB-based Translation of Virtual Addresses to Physical Addresses

The TLB-based translation of virtual addresses to physical addresses is described here.
For the convenience of description, the following is presented in pseudocode form with STLB first and MTLB second, while the hardware implementation of the processor can look up STLB and MTLB at the same time.

----
# va: virtual address to be found.
# mem_type: memory acess type. FETCH refers to fetch operation, LOAD refers to load operation, and STORE refers to store operation.
# plv: current privilege level, i.e., CSR.CRMD.PLV.
# pa: physical addresses after translation.
# mat: memory acess type after translation.
# VALEN: number of valid bits of the virtual address.
# PALEN: number of valid bits of the physical address.
# STLB[][]: STLB[N][M] refers to the Nth way and the Mth entry of STLB.
# STLB_WAY: number of ways of STLB.
# STLB_INDEX: the power of 2 of the number of groups in each way of STLB, i.e., each way has 2STLB_INDEX groups.
# MTLB[]: MTLB[N] refers to the Nth entry of MTLB.
# MTLB_ENTRIES: number of entries of MTLB.

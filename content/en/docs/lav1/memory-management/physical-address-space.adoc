=== Physical Address Space

The physical address space range of memory is `0`â€“`2^PALEN^-1`.

In LA32, `PALEN` is theoretically a positive integer not exceeding `32`, and its specific value is determined by the implementation, which is usually recommended to be `32`.

In LA64, `PALEN` is theoretically a positive integer not exceeding `60`, and its specific value is determined by the implementation.

The system software can determine the specific value of `PALEN` by reading the `PALEN` field of the `0x1` configuration word with the `CPUCFG` instruction.

==== Virtual Address Reduction Mode in LA64

In order to reduce the number of page table levels in some occasions, the virtual address reduction mode is also provided in LA64.
When the system software set `RDVA` in the `CSR.RVACFG` register to a value from `1` to `8`, the valid bits of the virtual address in mapped address translation mode are treated as `(VALEN-RDVA)` bits.
For example, when `VALEN=48` and `RDVA` is set to `8`, the `[63:40]` bits of the legal address must be a sign expansion of the `[39]` bit.

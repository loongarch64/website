==== Instruction Abbreviation

There are many instructions defined by LoongArch that appear frequently and have similar behaviors.
Generally, they only have some differences in operands.
For the convenience of readers, such instructions are often introduced together.
For the sake of brevity, this manual uses abbreviation rules for the instruction name.
`{A/B/C}` means to use `A`, `B`, and `C` to combine the instruction name.
`A[B]` means to use `A` and `AB` to combine the instruction name.
For example, `ADD.{W/D}` represents two instruction names `ADD.W` and `ADD.D`, while `BLT[U]` represents two instruction names `BLT` and BLTU.
A more complicated example is `ADD[I].{W/D}`, which represents four instruction names `ADD.W`, `ADD.D`, `ADDI.W` and `ADDI.D`.
Even though instruction names can be abbreviated, it does not mean that their opcode fields have similar contents.

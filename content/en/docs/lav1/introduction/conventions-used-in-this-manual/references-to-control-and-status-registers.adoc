==== References to Control and Status Registers

LoongArch defines a series of **C**ontrol and **S**tatus **R**egisters (CSRs), which are used to control the execution behavior of instructions.
Each CSR usually contains several fields.
This manual use `+CSR.%%%%.####+` to refer to the `+####+` field of the control and status register whose name is abbreviated as `+%%%%+`.
For example, `CSR.CRMD.PLV` represents the `PLV` field in the `CRMD` register.
When the virtualization extension is implemented, there are two sets of CSRs in the processor, one belongs to the Host and the other belongs to the Guest.
If the two sets of CSRs cannot be distinguished by the context, `CSR.XXXX` is used to represent the CSRs of the Host and `GCSR.XXXX` is used to represent the CSRs of the Guest.

=== Overview of LoongArch ISA

LoongArch has the typical characteristics of RISC.
LoongArch instructions are of fixed size and have regular instruction formats.
Most of the instructions have two source operands and one destination operand.
LoongArch is a load-store architecture; this means only the load/store instructions can access memory the operands of the other instructions are within the processor core or the immediate number in the instruction opcode.

LoongArch is divided into two versions, the 32-bit version (LA32) and the 64-bit version (LA64).
LA64 applications are "`application-level backward binary compatibility`" with LA32 applications.
That means LA32 applications can run directly on the machine compatible with LA64, but the behavior of system softwares (such as the kernel) on the machine compatible with LA32 is not guaranteed to be the same as on the machine compatible with LA64.

LoongArch is composed of a basic part (Loongson Base) and an expanded part, as shown in the figure.
The expansion part includes **L**oongson **B**inary **T**ranslation (LBT), **L**oongson **V**irtuali**Z**ation (LVZ), **L**oongson **S**IMD E**X**tension (LSX), and **L**oongson **A**dvanced **S**IMD E**X**tension(LASX).

The basic part of LoongArch includes an non-privileged instruction set and a privileged instruction set.
The non-privileged instruction set defines commonly used integer and floating-point instructions, which can adequately support the current mainstream compiler to generate efficient target codes.

The virtualization extension part of LoongArch is used for operating system virtualization to provide hardware acceleration to improve performance.
This part involves basically all privileged resources, including some privileged instructions and control and status registers, functions added in exceptions and interrupts, memory management, and so on.

The binary translation extension part of LoongArch is used to improve the execution efficiency of the cross-instruction system binary translation on the LoongArch platform.
It expands on the basic part and also includes two parts, the non-privileged instruction set and the privileged instruction set.

LoongArch vector instruction extension and advanced vector instruction extension both use SIMD instructions to accelerate CPU-bound applications.
They are basically the same in terms of instruction functions.
The difference is that the vector length of the vector instruction extension operation is 128 bits and the vector length of the advanced vector instruction extension operation is 256 bits.

For the architecture compatible with LoongArch, the basic part of the LoongArch must be implemented, and the extended part can be implemented optionally.
Each extension part can be selected flexibly, but when choosing to implement LASX, LSX must be implemented.
Some optional subsets of functions are included in the basic part and each extension part.
The software can detect whether these optional functions are implemented via the `CPUCFG` instruction.

The follow-up evolution of the LoongArch adopts a "`fine-grained incremental evolution`" method.
The so-called "`fine-grained`" means that each functional subset in the basic part or the extended part can evolve independently.
The so-called "`incremental`" means that for any part that can be evolved independently, the higher version is always forward binary compatible{empty}footnote:[Translator`'s note: Forward compatibility here may be ambiguous.] with the lower version.

Starting from Chapter 2 of this manual, the specification of the LoongArch will be described in detail.
The contents of Chapter 2 and 3 involve the non-privileged instruction set part of the architecture, including the function definitions of basic integer instructions and basic floating-point instructions and their application-level programming models.
Chapters 4 to 7 are used to describe the privileged resources in the architecture, mainly including the introduction of privileged instructions, control and status registers, function specifications in operating modes, exceptions and interrupts, memory management, and etc.
The pseudo-code descriptions designed to describe the function definitions of instructions are concentrated in Appendix A.
The specific coding definitions of the instructions involved are listed in Appendix B.

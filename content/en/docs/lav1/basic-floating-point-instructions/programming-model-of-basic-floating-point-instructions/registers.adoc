==== Registers

Floating-point instruction programming involves registers such as **F**loating-point **R**egister (FR), **C**ondition **F**lag **R**egister (CFR) and **F**loatingpoint **C**ontrol and **S**tatus **R**egister (FCSR).

===== Floating-point Registers

There are 32 FRs, denoted as `f0`–`f31`, each of which can be read and written.
Only when only floating-point instructions that manipulate single-precision floating-point numbers and word integers are implemented, the length of FR is 32 bits.
Under normal circumstances, the length of FR is 64 bits, regardless of the LA32 or LA64.
There is an "`orthogonal`" relationship between basic floating-point instructions and floating-point registers, that is, from an architectural perspective, any floating-point register operand in these instructions can use any one of the 32 FRs.

When the floating-point register records a single-precision floating-point number or word integer, the data always appears in the `[31:0]` bits of the floating-point register, at this time the `[63:32]` bits of the floating-point register can be any value.

===== Condition Flag Register

There are 8 CFRs, denoted as `fcc0`–`fcc7`, each of which can be read and written.
The length of CFR is 1 bit.
The result of the floating-point comparison will be written into the condition flag register.
When the comparison result is true, it is set to `1`, otherwise it is set to `0`.
The judgment condition of the floating-point branch instruction comes from the condition register.

===== Floating-point Control and Status Register

There are 4 FCSRs, denoted as `fcsr0`–`fcsr3`.
Among them, `fcsr1`–`fcsr3` are aliases of some fields in `fcsr0`, that is, accessing `fcsrl`–`fcsr3` is actually accessing some fields of `fcsr0`.
When the software writes `fcsr1`–`fcsr3`, the corresponding field in `fcsr0` is modified while the remaining bits remain unchanged.
The definition of each field of `fcsr0` is shown in the table.

|Description

|`4:0`
|Enables
|RW
|The floating-point operation `VZOUI` exceptions each allow the enable bit to trigger the exception trap.

Bit `4` corresponds to `V`, bit `3` corresponds to `Z`, bit `2` corresponds to `O`, bit `1` corresponds to `U`, and bit `0` corresponds to `I`.

|`9:8`
|RM
|RW
|Rounding mode control.
It contains 4 legal values, each with the following meaning:

`0`: RNE, corresponding to roundTiesToEven in IEEE 754-2008;

`1`: RZ, corresponding to roundTowardZero in IEE 754-2008;

`2`: RP, corresponding to roundTowardsPositive in IEEE 754-2008;

`3`: RM, corresponding to roundTowardsNegative in IEEE 754-2008.

|`20:16`
|Flags
|RW
|Since the last time the Flags field was cleared by the software, the cumulative status of various floating-point operations `VZOUI` exceptions that were generated but not caught.

Bit `20` corresponds to `V`, bit `19` corresponds to `Z`, bit `18` corresponds to `O`, bit `17` corresponds to `U`, and bit `16` corresponds to `I`.

|`28:24`
|Cause
|RW
|The `VZOUI` exception caused by the last floating-point operation.

Bit `28` corresponds to `V`, bit `27` corresponds to `Z`, bit `26` corresponds to `O`, bit `25` corresponds to `U`, and bit `24` corresponds to `I`.
|===

`FCSR1` is the alias of the `Enables` field in `FCSR0`.
Its location is the same as in `FCSR0`.

`FCSR2` is the alias of the `Cause` and `Flags` fields in `FCSR0`.
The location of each field is consistent with `FCSR0`.

`FCSR3` is the alias of the `RM` field in `FCSR0`.
Its location is the same as in `FCSR0`.

== Basic Floating-Point Instructions

This chapter will introduce the floating-point number instructions in the basic part of the non-privileged subset of LoongArch.
The function definition of the basic floating-point instructions in LoongArch follows the IEEE 754-2008 standard.

Basic floating-point instructions cannot be implemented separately from basic integer instructions.
Generally speaking, it recommends that implementing both basic integer instructions and basic floating-point instructions at the same time.
However, for some embedded applications that are cost-sensitive and have extremely low floating-point processing performance requirements, the architecture specification also allows not to implement basic floating-point instructions, or only implement single-precision floating-point numbers and word integers in basic floating-point instructions.
Whether the implementation of basic floating-point instructions includes instructions for operating double-precision floating-point numbers and double-word integers has nothing to do with whether the architecture is LA32 or LA64.
